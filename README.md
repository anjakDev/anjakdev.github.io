Not every developer needs their own website, but I thought it can't hurt to have one. Besides, it allows me to play around with Typescript and tailwindcss, and it gave me a chance to try out _bun_ instead of the usual npm approach (and I like it! I think I'm a bun-fan now? does the fanbase have a name? bunsters? bunions? bunanas? so many options!)

# Tech stack
- *bun* as a package manager and javascript runtime
- *tailwindcss* for quick and simple inline css styling
- String templating using typescript without a frontend framework - I wanted to keep it slim for now.

# Future plans
- I have yet to add content to all menu items, but I'm building this as a fun side project in whatever (currently sparingly available) free time I have and I want to think about different ideas for how I could display all that data in a fun, or unconventional, or at least pretty way, so I'm not rushing.
- I want to tinker with css animations, visual effects, and different colorways and design ideas. This page might change drastically as I go, I like a lot of different design approaches and don't want to commit to any one just yet. I'll see what feels right.

Enjoy following my process.
